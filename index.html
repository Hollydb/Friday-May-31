        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p class="info">I am Canadian from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton">Edmonton, Alberta</a>.  After quitting my job I decided it was time to pursure my dreams of finally learning to code.  I have done a handful of online courses but always get stuck and then give up, so I needed to find a class so I could get help from my peers.</p>
        <p>As it turns out the bootcamp model hasn't really made it to my city so I needed to expand my horizons;  after looking through the gazillions of bookcamp offerings, realizing what was ultimatly most important was the advailibity of good food and beer with some trees thrown in, I set my headlights to the south-west and came to Portland.</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Accountant by trade.  Just finished 2 years working at a large international accounting firm where I realized stuffy corporate culture is not for me.  Luckily for me the tediousness, patience and attendion to detail required for accounting is helping me out here;  spending all day trying to sort out why somthing doesn't balance has trained me well to spending all day trying to sort out why my code doesn't work.</li>
      <li>Spent four years as an adult education instructor;  teaching a mix of english,communications and buisness programs (an "about me" assignment was always my frist assignment too,  they were the best to read!)</li>
      <li>I have lived on 3 continents (Canada, Australia and Chile) and have travel to more then 80 countries.</li>
